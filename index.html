                <p>
                    Wine is defined for legal purposes as “a water and alcohol 
                    <br> solution obtained from the complete or partial fermentation 
                    <br> of fresh grapes or grape must.” Wine is made with 
                    <br> particular types of grapes known as Vitis Vinifera, otherwise 
                    <br> called wine grapes, that are small, sweet, 
                    <br> and have thicker skins.

                <p>
                    The basic ingredients of wine are water and alcohol, 
                    <br> though other components present in miniscule quantities 
                    <br> have a determining effect on quality and character. 
                    <br> Wine consists of:
                    <br>
                    Water (80%-85%)
                    <br> Alcohols (10%-20%)
                    <br> Acids (0.4%-1%)
                    <br> Sugars (0.1% (1 g/l)-10% (100 g/l)
                    <br> Mineral salts (0.2%-0.4%)
                    <br> Coloring substances (0.01 %-0.5 %)
                    <br> Aromatic substances (0.01%-0.1%)

                        <br> Fruit flavors in red wines typically fall into two
                        <br> different categories: red fruit and black fruit 
                        <br> flavors. Wines with more “black fruit” flavors
                        <br> tend to be more full-bodied.

                    <br> Secondary aromas in wine emerge from the fermentation process. Fermentation in wine is catalysed
                    <br> by a species of yeast known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is also known as brewer’s and baker’s 
                    <br> yeast. These can include…

                        <br> Traditionally wines are made to be dry or off-dry
                        <br> with the exception of late-harvest and dessert 
                        <br> wines. Sweetness can add body to a wine.

                        The acidity in a wine plays a very important role.
                        <br> Most wines are fairly acidic. You can tell how
                        <br> much acidity is in wine by how much you salivate 
                        <br> after you drink it. The acidity will take crisp,  
                        <br> zesty, and often create citrus or unripe
                        <br> fruit flavors.

                        <br> Tannins can often be confused with the dryness
                        <br> of the wine because they dry out your mouth. 
                        <br> They can taste bitter and herbaceous.
