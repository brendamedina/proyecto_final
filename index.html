                    Wine is defined for legal purposes as “a water and alcohol 
                    <br> solution obtained from the complete or partial fermentation 
                    <br> of fresh grapes or grape must.” Wine is made with 
                    <br> particular types of grapes known as Vitis Vinifera, otherwise 
                    <br> called wine grapes, that are small, sweet, 
                    <br> and have thicker skins.

                <p>
                    The basic ingredients of wine are water and alcohol, 
                    <br> though other components present in miniscule quantities 
                    <br> have a determining effect on quality and character. 
                    <br> Wine consists of:
                    <br>
                    Water (80%-85%)
                    <br> Alcohols (10%-20%)
                    <br> Acids (0.4%-1%)
                    <br> Sugars (0.1% (1 g/l)-10% (100 g/l)
                    <br> Mineral salts (0.2%-0.4%)
                    <br> Coloring substances (0.01 %-0.5 %)
                    <br> Aromatic substances (0.01%-0.1%)
                </p>

                        <br> They have more tannins and are richer in alcohol 
                        <br> content. The tannins are felt at the back of your 
                        <br> tongue as a grippy sensation that dries your 
                        <br> mouth and pulls it together.
